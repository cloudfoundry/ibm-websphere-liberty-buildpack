  # names to feature names, and to xpath expressions that will match if any of
  # the features are present in a server.xml feature element.

  # The component names are used in the component_index.yml file pointed to by
  # the index.yml file (except when the index.yml points directly to an
  # all-in-one Liberty download). The index.yml file is pointed to by the
